smart contract:  


how it works
- no current value, all you have is transaction history 
- every block refers back to previous block
- everyone solves the block and put it up as next block, but because it takes too long to solve 1 block its highly unlikely that 2 blocks will solve at same time
- also longest chain always win so even if there is seperation in chains, its highly unlikely for 2 to solve at same time in row
- that also means that its unlikely to forge a chain because you cant keep pace with rest of world's chain
- you also cant create chain in advance because next block requires reference to prev block and over time it becomes difficult to keep pace
- its also recommended to wait for few blocks to popup before confirming transaction 
- btc guild once solved 6 blocks in a row so you normally wait for 10 blocks because old part of chain is always stable or aggreed upon
