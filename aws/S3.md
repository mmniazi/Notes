# S3

- Object storage
- 0 to 5tb
- files is stored in buckets
- S3 is universal namespace so it should be unique globally
- Success reponse in 200 ok

- Key: name (data is ordered by key so similar name data is stored nearby on disk, so consider this for thorughput)
- Value: data 
- VersionID: versioning
- Metadata: date etc
- Subresources:
-- Access control list: who can access this object
-- Torrent: bit torrent protocol support

- Its 99.99% availabilty storage
- Amazon gives 99.9% SLA (Service level agreement) 
- Amazon gives 99.999999999 (11 9's) durabilty SLA
- Tiered storage
- Lifecycle management
- Multiple versions
- Encryption
- Access control lists and bucket policies
- Format: https://s3-{{region}}.amazonaws.com/{{bucketname}}/{{Key}}
- S3 objects and buckets are private by default
- S3 can be configured to store access logs

# Data consistency model
- Read after write for new objects
- Eventual consistency for overwrites and deletes as it may take some time for effect to appear, but till then
you will get old data, partial data is never shown.


# Tiers
- S3 (standard)
- S3-IA (Infrequent Accessed)
- Reduced Redundency Storage 99.99% durabilty
- Glacier very cheap but 3-5 hours retrival time

## Versioning
- You can not remove versioning you can only disable after its enabled for first time

## Lifecycle management

- Allows moving file and previous versions to S3-IA and Glacier and finally deletion after specified no
of days has passed
- Allows deleting incomplete multipart uploads
- For S3-IA object should be atleast 128kb and 30 days after creation
- Archive to Glacier can be done atleast 30 days after IA or if you are not doing IA 1 day after S3 upload
- Deleting must be done after 90 of glacier because glacier incurs cost for atleast 90 days

## Replication
- You can defined replication for s3 buckets in regions other than origin region
- You can replicate to single bucket and can not daisy chain
- Old files are not replicated but on new version upload all previous version are replicated
- Deletion are alse replicated but version or delete pointer deletion does not replicate

## Encryption
- InTransit: When you are sending data to and from your bucket, this is secured using SSL/TLS
- At Rest:
-- Server Side Encryption:
--- S3 Managed Keys: Automated encryption which we enable from console
--- AWS Key Management Service: Managed Keys, Similar to S3 Managed Keys but gives additional protection
by providing envolop key which protects your data encryption key. Also provides audits trail of who is decrypting
your data
--- Customer Provided Keys: You manage the keys and AWS manage the encryption as data arrive on disk
-- Client Side encryption: You encrypt the data and upload it to S3

## Transfer acceleration
- Instead of uploading to S3 you can upload to cloudfront edge network it will accelerate upload process but will
incur additional costs
