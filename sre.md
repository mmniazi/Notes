- tension between frequently releasing and stability
- solution is to define reliability we want to support and then release as frequent as possible while we are below realibility measure
- realibility measure is called error budget
- metrics we care about changes from service to service
- for client facing services relevant metrics are found by discussing bussiness goals with product manager to find out what is most important for bussiness
- for infrastucture services, because their use is too generic give end user multiple options with different relaibility options so they can select most cost effective option
- while selecting desired availability we have to calculate how much value we will generate by adding one more level of 9, vs how much effort it takes
- also availbility is effected by type of data we are handling forexample its better to shutdown a service with pii data if its malfunctioning then to keep up while maintanence is going on
- instead of time based availabilty we prefer aggregate (rq/s) or percentage availabilty
- canarying: testing new release on a subset of original traffic
- error budget: remaining unreliability we can spend
- we dont want anything above required minimum reliability (put that effort on innovation instead of reliability)
- sli: service level indicator: latency, failre rate other measurable metrics
- slo: value of sli we want to support
- sla: is an agreement for predefined penalities if slo is not met (normally done with 3rd parties). e.g google search does not have sla but google work apps does
- dont over achieve, otherwise users will have start expecting more than slo
